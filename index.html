  <!--Who Did I Research?-->
  <h3 class="WDIR">Who Did I Research?</h3>
  <h5 class="WDIR">My research centered on my father, Stan, grandparents Igor and Nora Magilevich, step-grandfather Aron Rozenberg, and great-grandparents Yuli and Rose Galperin. It begins with Yuli and Rose; Yuli was a soldier for the Red Army during WWII, and Rose was a Red Army nurse. My Jewish grandmother, Nora, got divorced from my grandfather, remarried, and fled the Soviet Union with her husband, Aron Rozenberg, and young son in 1979, when she was pregnant.</h5>

  <!--How Does My Familie's History Connect To United States History?-->
  <h3 class="HDFC">How Does My Family's History Connect to American History?</h3>
  <h5 class="HDFC">Part 1: Fleeing The Country<br><br>
    My family history relates to American History through war, immigration, and refuge. My great-grandparents were Russian-Jewish, and their names were Yuli and Rose. Yuli was a soldier in the Red Army, and Rose was a Red Army nurse. In 1948, they had a daughter named Nora, who eventually became my grandmother. In 1968, Nora gets married to a man named Igor and afterwards gives birth to a son named Stan in 1970 who later becomes my father. Nora and Igor divorced in 1979, and soon after, Nora got married to a new man named Aron Rozenberg. Later in the year, during the Cold War era, Aron and Nora had decided to flee the USSR with Stan at age 8 to travel to the U.S.A. My stepmom was also pregnant with a second child upon their escape. They utilize a program called "Birthright Israel" and travel to Austria and remain there for two weeks. They travel to Italy next and remain for three months, and then continue to New York when they have the papers. My grandmother had changed the family's last name to Rozenberg upon arrival and gave birth to a son named Arthur, born in October of that same year. </h5>
  <h5 class="HDFC"> Part 2: Cross-Country<br><br>
Four years passed, and my uncle Arthur had been dealing with allergy attacks due to the New York weather. They decided to move and settle in Los Angeles in 1983 to help alleviate Arthur's weather allergy. Stan had started going back to school and making new friends.
  </h5>
  <h5 class="HDFC"> Part 3: Adulthood<br><br>
    When Stan was 18 years old, he became a college student to pursue law. After realizing it wasn't his thing, he decided to make the switch to Sociology. Many years went by, and Aron is lying in bed in the hospital and, sadly, was pronounced dead. Stan was 26 and when he heard the news it got to him and he began failing in his classes. During this time, he meets a girl named Diana. Diana already had a boyfriend who was a friend of Stan's but he was still in love anyway. I have no clue how or why, but he asks Diana, "Will you marry me?" Diana waves it off and says to her boyfriend, "See, I just met this guy and he already asked me to marry him." A week later, Diana's boyfriend travels to Moscow for business because of the fall of the USSR. This is when my dad proposes again, and this time, Diana says yes. They moved to Las Vegas and got married straight away. They had their first baby afterwards. My older brother, Aaron Rozenberg, was named in honor of my stepdad.</h5>

  <!--My Research process-->
  <h3 class="MRP">My Research Process</h3>
  <h5 class="MRP">I interviewed my father, his ex-wife, and my mother, researched family documents and photos, and researched Soviet Jewish emigration. My father, with good reason, had some reluctance at times to do the interview. Sometimes, I had to wait a day or two because of my parents’ work. I could not interview my grandmother and uncle due to family issues.</h5>

  <!--What Did I Learn?-->
  <h3 class="WDIL">What Did I Learn That I Didn't Know Before?</h3>
  <h5 class="WDIL">I learned a lot about my family that I hadn’t previously known. I have seen how much work it was for my family to get to the United States and how much work they did when they were in the USSR as well. My father's story started as a strange, Russian boy who understood very little English, to an incredible father and businessman who is proud to be in the United States. It all goes to show how much work they all did to bring our family to where we are now.</h5>
