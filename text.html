  <!--Who Did I Research?-->
  <h3 class="WDIR">Who Did I Research?</h3>
  <h5 class="WDIR">My research centered upon my father, Stan, my grandparents, Igor and Nora Magilevich, my step-grandfather, Aron Rozenberg, and my great-grandparents, Yuli (Julius) and Rose Galperin. The story begins with my great grandparents Yuli and Rose. Yuli fought as an ally for Russia alongside the United States in World War II and Rose was a nurse in the Red Army. Later, my grandmother Nora, who was Jewish, divorced my grandfather and later married a new man. Afterwards she decided to flee the Soviet Union while pregnant and with her husband Aron Rozenberg and young son in 1979.</h5>

  <!--How Does My Familie's History Connect To United States History?-->
  <h3 class="HDFC">How Does My Family's History Connect to American History?</h3>
  <h5 class="HDFC">Part 1: Fleeing The Country<br><br>
    My family's history connects to American History through war, immigration, and refuge. My grandparents, Yuli and Rose, were Russian-Jewish; Yuli fought for the Red Army, while Rose was a nurse for the army. Later, in 1948, they have a child, who later becomes my grandmother, Nora. In 1968, Nora marries Igor and later has my father, Stan, in 1970, Nora and Igor divorce and later she marries a new man, Aron Rozenberg. In 1979, during the Cold War, Aron and Nora chose to flee the USSR with Stan, who was 8 years old, to go to the U.S.A. My stepmother was expecting another child when they left. They take advantage of a program called "Birthright Israel," travelling to Austria where they stay for two weeks. Next they travel to Italy, where they spend three months before arriving to New York. My grandmother changed the family last name to Rozenberg, and my uncle, Arthur, was born that November of 1979. </h5>
  <h5 class="HDFC"> Part 2: Assimilation<br><br>
    My uncle Arthur had been getting allergic reactions because of the New York climate. They eventually moved and settled in Los Angeles in 1983 in an attempt to cure Arthur's climate allergy. That is where my family started assimilating into American culture. Stan began going to middle school and made new friends and overtime, he started fluently speaking English.</h5>

  <!--My Research process-->
  <h3 class="MRP">My Research Process</h3>
  <h5 class="MRP">For my research process, I conducted one-on-one interviews with my father, reviewed family documents and photos, and researched the Soviet Jewish emigration theme. I also made use of online archives. to enhance my understanding of the broader historical context. Due to some family issues, I wasn't able to contact my grandmother or uncle.</h5>

  <!--What Did I Learn?-->
  <h3 class="WDIL">What Did I Learn That I Didn't Know Before?</h3>
  <h5 class="WDIL">One thing I learned that I didn't know before was how much my father struggled with identity and belonging during his early years in the United States. His journey from a lonely boy who barely spoke English to a father commuting weekly between Las Vegas and Los Angeles to be with my brother was powerful. It goes to show how hard he worked to get all of us where we are today.</h5>
